## Salient Features
1. The project follows proper Spring MVC architecture.
2. If a user jumps directly to a secure URL without Logging in, he will automatically be redirected to the home page for logging in/signing up.
3. After a user has logged in, pressing back won’t log him out (it’ll keep the user on the dashboard). To log out, user has to manually “Log out”. 
4. After a user has logged out, pressing the back button will redirect to the home page for logging in/signing up.
5. Strict validation checks are in place for logging in and signing up forms. Robust exceptional handling has been done wherever user input is involved. 
6. The code is clean, concise and maintainable. The UI is user-friendly. ([I’m not lying](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZjMkrQWHYPqnWvfg8) 🤥)

## Screenshots

Believe it or not, I’m as eager as you to see the screenshots of my project. When I did this project, during a 6-month internship, I forgot to take screenshots.  

In order to generate the screenshots now, I’ll have to create the database again - which is **very easy**, but time-consuming.

Anyways, at the end of the day, you’d be judging me on my **DSA and low level design skills**. So what are we waiting for? Kindly contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-salat/) and schedule an interview.
